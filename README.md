# Cookie-Grab
### THAT'S NOT MY CODE. I JUST MADE IT MORE FRIENDLY(UX).

I was leading to web scraping a page to make it more efficient, I searched for a way to get Chrome cookies so I can use them in my requests as a method of authentication. ~~Since I didn't use a virtualenv for that, you might have to install some dependencies:~~
```bash
pip3 install pycryptodome pypiwin32
```

**changelog: Virtualenv is now available.**
